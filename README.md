# Phidata Video AI Summarizer Agent üé•üé§üñ¨

This Streamlit application uses the Phidata Agent framework, powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model, to analyze and summarize video content. It allows users to upload video files and ask questions about the video, leveraging both the video content and supplementary web research through DuckDuckGo.

## Features

-   **Video Upload:** Users can upload video files (MP4, MOV, AVI).
-   **AI-Powered Analysis:** The application uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model to analyze the video content.
-   **Contextual Question Answering:** Users can ask questions about the video, and the AI agent will provide detailed, user-friendly, and actionable responses.
-   **Web Research:** The agent uses DuckDuckGo for supplementary web research to enhance the analysis.
-   **Streamlit Interface:** A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
-   **Temporary File Handling:** Uses tempfiles to process uploaded videos, and cleans up the files after processing.
-   **Environment Variable API Key:** Uses .env files to store API keys.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with the Generative Language API enabled.
-   A valid Google API key.
-   `pip` package manager.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
        ```

    -   Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
